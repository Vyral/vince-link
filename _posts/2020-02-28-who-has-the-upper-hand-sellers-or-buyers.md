<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s your latest market update for Bakersfield and Kern County.</em></p>

Right now, is our Kern County market better for buyer’s or seller’s? **Due to low inventory, we’re definitely in a seller’s market.&nbsp;**

Whenever there are fewer homes on the market, it means sellers can dictate more prices and better terms for themselves. There are a lot of buyers in the market, and this is creating a lot of multiple-offer scenarios. So if you’re thinking about selling soon, now’s the time to do so.&nbsp;

We actually have less than 60 days of active inventory, and here’s what that means: If no other homes were to come on the market today, it would take just 60 days to sell everything that’s already active.&nbsp;

Sellers should be aware that **this low inventory is increasing the value of their homes**—demand is high, supply is low, prices rise.&nbsp;

What about interest rates? Right now, they’re hovering between 3.5% and 4.5%, which is allowing buyers to increase their buying power. This boon to buyers is actually great for sellers, too; more buyers want to take advantage of locking in low rates, so they all jump into the market, creating even more multiple offers for sellers.&nbsp;

In this Bakersfield market, sellers can nab top dollar for their home and probably do so quicker than a balanced market would allow. **Buyers, on the other hand, will face more competition,** so the home buying process may take you longer than you’re expecting; plan ahead for this by making sure you allot yourself plenty of time when crafting deadlines.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about buying soon, get connected with a great real estate agent like myself and my team, so we can help you move in the right direction and get your offer accepted.&nbsp;
