Here are the five most important questions to ask while house hunting:

**1\. How’s the neighborhood/area?** A home’s neighborhood/area affects how it appreciates, and not all areas appreciate at the same rate. Homes in areas with great schools and a lot of commercial development will appreciate faster than homes in other areas. Take this value into consideration, because your home is an investment in your future.

**2\. How are the schools?** Realtors can’t tell you how good a school is, but they can direct you to several websites that will show you a school’s statistics so you can do the research yourself and decide what’s most important to you.&nbsp;

**3\. How is the commute?** Here in Bakersfield, there’s a lot of new construction happening out there, so commute times can vary. There are a lot of factors you may have to consider—coming and going from work, dropping the kids off at school, etc. You don’t want to move somewhere only to realize you’ve doubled your commute.&nbsp;

**4\. What’s the average cost of utilities?** To answer this question for our homebuyer clients, we request the previous 12 months’ utility bills from the home’s previous owner. Granted, this can change based on your usage of those utilities. Having a big family or using solar panels, for instance, are things you might have to factor in your costs so you can save the most money.&nbsp;

**5\. Which big-ticket items will cost you the most money if they don’t work?** Big-ticket items include the home’s roof, foundation, air conditioning unit, and water heater. Make sure these items are inspected correctly so any issues can be addressed during the escrow process. This way, once you move in, you have peace of mind knowing that everything is in top-notch condition.
